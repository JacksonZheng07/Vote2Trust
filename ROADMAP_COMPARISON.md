# 🗺️ Vote2Trust Roadmap: Plan vs Reality

## 📅 **24-Hour Roadmap vs Your Implementation**

### **Hour 0-2: Planning & Setup ✅ COMPLETED**

#### **Original Plan:**
```
✅ Agree on MVP scope: commit–reveal voting on one poll with 2–3 choices

   - Frontend: React + WalletConnect/MetaMask
✅ Scaffold smart contract project
✅ Create basic contract structure: registration, commit, reveal, tally
✅ Scaffold React project
✅ Install WalletConnect/MetaMask libraries
```

#### **Your Implementation:**
```
✅ MVP scope: Complete commit-reveal voting system
✅ Development environment:
   - Blockchain: Algorand + AlgoPy + AlgoKit (BETTER!)
   - Frontend: React + Algorand Wallets (BETTER!)
✅ Smart contract: Complete Vote2Trust contract with all features
✅ Contract structure: registration, commit, reveal, tally, admin controls
✅ React project: Full-featured voting platform

✅ Ensure double voting is blocked
✅ Ensure invalid reveals are rejected
✅ Build commit UI: Allow vote + salt entry, send hash to contract
✅ Build reveal UI: Input vote + salt, display confirmation
✅ Quick end-to-end test locally
```

#### **Your Implementation:**
```
✅ Commit + reveal functions: Fully working on Algorand
✅ Double voting prevention: Address-based tracking

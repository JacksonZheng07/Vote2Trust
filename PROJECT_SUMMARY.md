## üéØ Problem Statement

Traditional voting systems suffer from critical flaws that undermine trust, transparency, and accessibility:

### Trust & Transparency Issues
- **Centralized Control**: Single points of failure and potential manipulation
- **Lack of Verifiability**: Voters cannot verify their votes were counted correctly
- **Audit Trail Gaps**: No immutable record of the voting process
- **Transparency Deficits**: Limited visibility into vote counting and processing

### Security Vulnerabilities
- **Double Voting**: Same person can vote multiple times
- **Vote Tampering**: Votes can be altered after submission
- **Identity Exposure**: Voter choices may be linked to identities
- **Coercion Vulnerability**: Voters can be forced to prove their vote choice

### Accessibility Barriers
- **High Costs**: Expensive to run secure, transparent elections
- **Geographic Limitations**: Physical presence often required
- **Technical Barriers**: Complex systems exclude many potential voters
- **Low Participation**: Especially in online and community elections

## üí° Solution: Vote2Trust

Vote2Trust leverages Algorand's blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and accessible voting platform that addresses all traditional voting system flaws.

### Core Innovation: Commit-Reveal Voting
1. **Commit Phase**: Voters submit cryptographic hash of their vote + random salt
2. **Reveal Phase**: Voters reveal their actual vote and salt for verification
3. **Verification**: System verifies hash matches the committed value
4. **Counting**: Verified votes are counted and results published on blockchain

### Key Benefits
- **üîê Cryptographic Security**: Votes protected by hash functions and random salts
- **üëÅÔ∏è Complete Transparency**: All transactions visible and verifiable on blockchain
- **üîç Full Verifiability**: Voters can verify their vote was counted correctly
- **üö´ Double Voting Prevention**: Smart contracts enforce single vote per address
- **üí∞ Cost Effective**: Low transaction fees on Algorand ($0.001 per vote)
- **‚ö° Fast Processing**: 4.5-second block times enable real-time voting
- **üåç Global Accessibility**: No geographic restrictions, works anywhere

## üîí Security Implementation

### Cryptographic Security
- **Salt Generation**: 256-bit cryptographically secure random salt
- **Hash Creation**: SHA-256 hash of vote choice + salt
- **Hash Verification**: Smart contract verifies hash matches commitment
- **Vote Protection**: Votes remain anonymous until reveal phase

### Access Control
- **Admin Functions**: Only authorized admins can create polls and manage phases
- **Voter Registration**: Only registered voters can participate
- **Phase Control**: Voting phases are strictly enforced
- **Double Voting Prevention**: Smart contracts prevent multiple votes

### Blockchain Security

# 🔧 Vote2Trust Technical Documentation

## 📋 Project Summary
**Vote2Trust: Secure, transparent, anonymous voting platform on Algorand using commit-reveal mechanism for democratic decision-making.**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional voting systems suffer from critical flaws:

### Trust & Transparency Issues
- **Centralized Control**: Single points of failure and manipulation
- **Lack of Verifiability**: Voters cannot verify their votes were counted
- **Audit Trail Gaps**: No immutable record of voting process
- **Transparency Deficits**: Limited visibility into vote counting process

### Security Vulnerabilities
- **Double Voting**: Same person can vote multiple times
- **Vote Tampering**: Votes can be altered after submission
- **Identity Exposure**: Voter choices may be linked to identities
- **Coercion Vulnerability**: Voters can be forced to prove their vote

### Accessibility Barriers
- **High Costs**: Expensive to run secure elections
- **Geographic Limitations**: Physical presence often required
- **Technical Barriers**: Complex systems exclude many voters
- **Low Participation**: Especially in online/community elections

## 💡 Solution: Vote2Trust

Vote2Trust leverages Algorand's blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and accessible voting platform.

### Core Innovation: Commit-Reveal Voting
1. **Commit Phase**: Voters submit cryptographic hash of their vote + random salt
2. **Reveal Phase**: Voters reveal their actual vote and salt for verification
3. **Verification**: System verifies hash matches the committed value
4. **Counting**: Verified votes are counted and results published

### Key Benefits
- **🔐 Cryptographic Security**: Votes protected by hash functions
- **👁️ Transparency**: All transactions visible on blockchain
- **🔍 Verifiability**: Voters can verify their vote was counted
- **🚫 Double Voting Prevention**: Smart contracts enforce single vote per address
- **💰 Cost Effective**: Low transaction fees on Algorand
- **⚡ Fast Processing**: 4.5-second block times

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Cryptographic Security
```python
# Salt Generation (Frontend)
const generateSecureSalt = (): string => {
    const array = new Uint8Array(32) // 256 bits of entropy
    crypto.getRandomValues(array)
    return Array.from(array, byte => byte.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('')
}

# Hash Generation (Frontend)
const generateHash = (choice: string, salt: string): string => {
    const combined = choice + salt
    const encoder = new TextEncoder()
    const data = encoder.encode(combined)
    return Array.from(data, byte => byte.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('')
}

# Hash Verification (Smart Contract)
@abimethod
def reveal_vote(self, vote_choice: UInt64, salt: Bytes) -> None:
    # Verify the hash matches the committed hash
    expected_hash = Bytes(vote_choice.bytes + salt)
    assert expected_hash == self.vote_commit_hash, "Hash verification failed"
```

### Access Control
```python
# Admin-only functions
@abimethod
def create_poll(self, ...) -> None:
    assert Txn.sender == self.admin.value, "Only admin can create polls"

# Phase-based access control
@abimethod
def commit_vote(self, vote_hash: Bytes) -> None:
    assert self.voting_phase.value == UInt64(2), "Commit phase not active"
    assert self.voter_registered == UInt64(1), "Must be registered to vote"
```

### Double Voting Prevention
```python
# Check if voter already committed
@abimethod
def commit_vote(self, vote_hash: Bytes) -> None:
    assert self.vote_committed == UInt64(0), "Already committed vote"
    self.vote_committed = UInt64(1)
```

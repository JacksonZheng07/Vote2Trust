# Vote2Trust - Decentralized Voting Platform

A complete blockchain-based voting system built on Algorand using commit-reveal voting mechanism for secure, transparent, and anonymous voting.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Traditional voting systems face challenges like:
- **Lack of Trust**: Users don't trust centralized authorities handling votes
- **Transparency Gaps**: Voters can't verify that votes weren't tampered with
- **Double Voting**: Existing systems can allow multiple votes from the same user
- **Identity Leaks**: Ballots may not be fully anonymous
- **Low Participation**: Especially in online or student/corporate elections

## 💡 Blockchain Solution

Vote2Trust provides:
- **🔐 Anonymity**: Keeps votes private until reveal phase
- **🧾 Verifiability**: Voters can verify their vote was counted
- **🔁 Double Voting Prevention**: Smart contracts enforce single vote per address
- **💡 Transparency**: All interactions are on-chain, auditable
- **🧱 Immutability**: No one can alter past data or results

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contract (Algorand)
- **Language**: Python with AlgoPy
- **Features**: Commit-reveal voting, voter registration, phase management
- **Security**: Admin controls, hash verification, deadline enforcement

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Wallet Integration**: Algorand wallet support (Pera, Defly, Exodus)
- **UI**: Modern, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks with real-time updates

## 🔄 Voting Process Flow

### 1. Registration Phase
- Users connect their Algorand wallet
- Register as eligible voters
- System verifies eligibility

### 2. Commit Phase
- Voters select their choice
- Generate random salt
- Create hash of (vote + salt)
- Submit hash to blockchain
- Vote remains secret

### 3. Reveal Phase
- Voters provide original vote + salt
- System verifies hash matches commitment
- Vote is revealed and counted
- Results are tallied

### 4. Results Phase
- Final vote counts displayed
- Winner determination
- Blockchain verification
- Results export available

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.11+
- Algorand wallet (Pera, Defly, etc.)

### Backend Setup (Smart Contracts)

```bash
cd projects/Vote2Trust-contracts
